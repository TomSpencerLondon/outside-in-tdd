### Different types of tests

- Acceptance (RTL)
- State management (enzyme + class component)
- conditional rendering (enzyme + function component)
- user interaction (RTL)
- UI design (storybook)

### Notes

- use a FetchSection instead, it should be less confusing
- add all stories in a git patch
- don't do this at home
- Single Responsibility Principle
